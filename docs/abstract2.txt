Abstract

Autonomous mobile robots require efficient localization and navigation strategies to operate in dynamic environments. This research presents a behavior tree-based navigation framework that enables a robot to move between predefined markers while dynamically updating its localization. The system uses marker-based visual localization, where an onboard camera detects and tracks markers. If a marker is not found, a structured search behavior, including rotational scanning and incremental movements, is executed until detection is successful.

The robot correlates marker positions to refine its trajectory and updates its localization using relative pose estimation. A parallel obstacle avoidance module processes data from a simple RGB camera, ensuring real-time detection of nearby obstacles. The use of behavior trees enhances modularity, allowing flexible and scalable decision-making.

A key advantage of this system is its minimal hardware requirements, relying only on a camera and onboard processing, making it cost-effective and accessible. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in warehouse automation, search-and-rescue, and autonomous logistics. The combination of marker-based localization, obstacle-aware navigation, and behavior tree-based decision-making provides a structured yet adaptable framework for real-world autonomous navigation.
